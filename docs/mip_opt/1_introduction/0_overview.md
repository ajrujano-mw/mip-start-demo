# Mip Optimization
In this program, you will learn why *mathematical optimization*
(also known as *mathematical programming*) is the 
primary technology for doing prescriptive analytics, and how to use 
it to solve prescriptive analytics problems across a variety of industries.

But don't think that mathematical optimization is only for
optimization tasks. In many cases, we just need to find a
solutions that meet a list of requirements (puzzles are a good example 
of this). There are also dedicated technologies for solving these
types of problem. *Constraint Programing* is one of them as we will
discuss later.

In fact, mathematical optimization can be used to model and solve
an incredibly large range of decision-making problems as we will
see in this program. 

This technology is particularly useful for 
complex problems where lots of interconnected decisions must be made. 
The [Digit Tracking][digit_tracking] puzzle illustrates this very well. 
If you place the number 3 in the cell with label 2, then the number 
2 must be placed in three distinct cells, and that will imply that 
three other numbers will have to appear twice, and so on.

In some other cases, the decision-making problems is not so complex
in the sense that decisions are highly dependent on each other,
but decisions must be synchronized to achieve certain requirements.
For example, in the Diet Problem, we must decide how
much to buy of each food while accounting for the minimum amount of
total calories in the diet.
