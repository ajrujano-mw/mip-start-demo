# Next Steps
**You made it!**  
Another module covered.

We expect that by now you and your Mip Mentor have already defined the data,
the modeling approach, and the algorithms/tools that you are going to use 
to solve your problem.

In the next module, you will start to implement your solution and build your 
application!
