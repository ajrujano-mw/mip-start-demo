Suppose that the rows of $A$ are linearly independent (which implies that $n\\\\leq m$, i.e., the LP has more variables than constraints).\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWe rewrite the LP above by decomposing the decision variables between *basic* and *non-basic* variables. Let $B$ and $N$ be the set of indices of the basic and non-basic variables, respectively, where $B$ has $m$ elements and $N$ has $n-m$ elements. Then we write $x$ as follows:\\n$$\\nx = \\n\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\nx_B\\\\\\\\\\nx_N\\n\\\\end{bmatrix}\\n$$\\n\\nSimilarly we decompose $c$ and $A$ as follows:\\n$$\\nc = \\n\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\nc_B\\\\\\\\\\nc_N\\n\\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\quad\\nA = \\n\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\nA_B & A_N\\n\\\\end{bmatrix}\\n$$\\n\\nNow we rewrite the problem as follows:\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{rcl}\\n& \\\\min & c^T_B x_B + c^T_N x_N\\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\text{s.t.}& A_B x_B + A_N x_N = b\\\\\\\\\\n&& x_B, x_N \\\\geq 0.\\n\\\\end{array}\\n$$\\n\\nSince we have assumed that the rows of $A$ are linearly independent, we know that $A_B$ is an invertible matrix. Therefore, we can rewrite the constraints as follows:\\n$$\\nA_B x_B + A_N x_N = b\\\\\\\\\\nA_B x_B = b - A_N x_N\\\\\\\\\\nx_B = A_B^{-1}(b - A_N x_N)\\\\\\\\\\nx_B = A_B^{-1}b - A_B^{-1}A_N x_N.\\n$$\\n\\nBy using this expression for $x_B$, the objective function can be re-written as:\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\nc^T_B x_B + c^T_N x_N &= c^T_B (A_B^{-1}b - A_B^{-1}A_N x_N) + c^T_N x_N\\\\\\\\\\n&= c^T_B A_B^{-1}b - c^T_BA_B^{-1}A_N x_N + c^T_N x_N\\\\\\\\\\n&= c^T_B A_B^{-1}b - (c^T_BA_B^{-1}A_N + c^T_N) x_N\\\\\\\\\\n&= c^T_B A_B^{-1}b + (c^T_N - c^T_BA_B^{-1}A_N) x_N.\\n\\\\end{align*}\\n$$\\n\\nThe problem now becomes:\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{rcl}\\n& \\\\min & c^T_B A_B^{-1}b + (c^T_N - c^T_BA_B^{-1}A_N) x_N\\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\text{s.t.}& x_B = A_B^{-1}b - A_B^{-1}A_N x_N\\\\\\\\\\n&& x_B, x_N \\\\geq 0.\\n\\\\end{array}\\n$$\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{rcl}\\n& \\\\min & c^T_B A_B^{-1}b\\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\text{s.t.}& x_B = A_B^{-1}b\\\\\\\\\\n&& x_B\\\\geq 0.\\n\\\\end{array}\\n$$\\n\\nAt any iteration of the simplex method, the non-basic variables are set to zero, i.e., $x_N=0$. As a result, the values of the basic variables are given by $x_B = A_B^{-1}b$. And the objective value is given by $c^T_B A_B^{-1}b$.\\n\\nTo perform a simplex iteration (which is called a pivoting), we attempt to increase one of the non-basic variables from zero. But which one should we choose?\\n\\nTo answer this question, we need to re-write the problem using summation notation:\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{rcl}\\n& \\\\min & c^T_B A_B^{-1}b + \\\\sum_{j\\\\in N}(c_j - c^T_BA_B^{-1}A^j) x_j\\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\text{s.t.}& x_B = A_B^{-1}b - \\\\sum_{j\\\\in N}A_B^{-1}A^j x_j\\\\\\\\\\n&& x_B \\\\geq 0, x_j \\\\geq 0, \\\\forall j \\\\in N.\\n\\\\end{array}\\n$$\\n\\nFrom here, it\u2019s easy to see that it only makes sense to increase from zero a non-basic variable $x_j$ if its coefficient $c_j - c^T_BA_B^{-1}A^j$ is negative. This coefficient is called the *reduced cost* of $x_j$. In fact, if the reduced cost of $x_j$ is negative, then increasing $x_j$ will decrease the objective value, which is desirable since this is a minimization problem. On the other hand, if the reduced cost of every non-basic variable is non-negative, we conclude that the current solution is optimal.\\n\\nNow that we have a way to decide which non-basic variable can be made a basic variable (i.e., pick one with negative reduced cost), suppose $x_1$ is non-basic and has negative reduced cost. From an optimization perspective, we want to increase $x_1$ as much as possible. What can stop us from increasing $x_1$ indefinitely?\\n\\nThe answer comes from the expression\\n$$\\nx_B = A_B^{-1}b - \\\\sum_{j\\\\in N}A_B^{-1}A^j x_j.\\n$$\\nWhich is same as\\n$$\\nx_B = A_B^{-1}b - A_B^{-1}A^1 x_1\\n$$\\nsince $x_j=0$ for all $j\\\\in N$ such that $j\\\\neq 1$.\\n\\nTherefore, if the vector $A_B^{-1}A^1$ has any positive component, as we increase $x_1$ the corresponding basic variables on the right-hand-side will decrease, and eventually one of them will reach zero and become a non-basic variable! If we were to keep increasing $x_1$, then some basic variables would become negative, which is not allowed as all variables must be non-negative. This completes one iteration of the simplex method."},{"id":"resourcefulness","metadata":{"permalink":"/mip-start-demo/articles/resourcefulness","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-28-resourcefulness.md","title":"Resourcefulness","description":"Resourcefulness is one of the most powerful word you","date":"2019-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"resourcefulness","permalink":"/mip-start-demo/articles/tags/resourcefulness"},{"label":"philosophy","permalink":"/mip-start-demo/articles/tags/philosophy"}],"readingTime":1.715,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Aster Santana","title":"CEO and founder of MipWise","url":"https://github.com/endiliey","imageURL":"https://github.com/endiliey.png","key":"aster"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"resourcefulness","title":"Resourcefulness","authors":"aster","tags":["resourcefulness","philosophy"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Derivation of the simplex algorithm","permalink":"/mip-start-demo/articles/the-simplex-algorithm"}},"content":"Resourcefulness is one of the most powerful word you\\nhave ever seen.
