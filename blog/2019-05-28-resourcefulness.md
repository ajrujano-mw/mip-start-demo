# Resourcefulness

Resourcefulness is one of the most powerful word you
have ever seen. You may have not realized that until
now, and that's why we dedicated this section to it.

<!--truncate-->

Let's start with three pair of words formed by a noun 
and a verb that deserve each other:
* Goal - Achieve
* Challenge - Overcome
* Creativity - Innovate

By combining these words we can come up with the following
definition of resourcefulness:
*The ability to use creativity to innovate and overcome
challenges to achieve goals*.

Now, here is a question for you:  
How often do you need to overcome challenges to achieve goals?

If you say "not often", it's because you are not setting 
big enough goals. Which means that you have settled in your 
comfort zone and are missing opportunity to grow.

If your answer is "quite often" or "very often", then
here is another question for you:  
How often do you use creativity to innovate and overcome
challenges?

If you say "not often", then you have probably been 
consuming more resources than you need and, again, leaving
opportunities on the table.

You might say: "Well, if I have plenty of resources, why
should I bother?"

It's a fair question. But think this way: if you have plenty
of resources, then you should rise the bar for your goals.
Then you will find opportunities to be resourceful again,
just that in another level.

After all, what is so powerful about the word resourcefulness?  
Very simple: **resourcefulness is itself a true source of innovation.**

Didn't get it? Then check out the book *Sky Color, by Peter H. Reynolds*.
It's a children book that you should consider buying to your
kids, or a kid you know. In the meantime, you can watch this video:

Putting it simply, resourcefulness is all about doing more
with less. Which is itself a goal and a challenge.
And creativity is the mean by which we do more with less.
Then innovation is the outcome.
